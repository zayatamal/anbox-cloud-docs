# Deprecation notices

This document contains a list of deprecation notices for Anbox Cloud and its components.

## VM images
*Deprecated in 1.28.0* ; *Unsupported in 1.30.0*

The VM variant of Anbox images for all versions are deprecated as of release 1.28.0. Use the container based images instead.

## Bundles
*Deprecated in 1.28.0* ; *Unsupported in 1.30.0*

The bundles [Anbox Cloud](https://charmhub.io/anbox-cloud) and [Anbox Cloud Core](https://charmhub.io/anbox-cloud-core) are deprecated as of release 1.28.0.

## Android 12, Android 13, and AAOS 13
*Deprecated in 1.27.1* ; *Unsupported in 1.29.0*

Support for the Android 12, Android 13, and AAOS 13 images will be deprecated starting with release 1.27.1 and will be unsupported as of release 1.29.0.

(node-controller-charm)=
## Node controller charm
*Deprecated in 1.26.0* ; *Unsupported in 1.28.0*

The [AMS node controller charm](https://charmhub.io/ams-node-controller) is deprecated as of 1.26.0. The charm is mainly responsible for installing the `ams-node-controller`. In future releases, this snap installation will be done using the `ams-lxd` charm.

## Juju 2.9
*Deprecated in 1.25.1* ; *Unsupported in 1.27.0*

Juju 2.9 is deprecated as of 1.25.1. Upgrade to Juju 3.6 instead. See [Juju upgrade documentation](https://canonical.com/juju/docs/juju-cli/latest/user/howto/manage-your-deployment/upgrade-your-deployment/) for detailed instructions.

For all new deployments, use the Juju snap from 3/stable or the latest/stable channel.

## Kernels older than 6.8
*Deprecated in 1.25.0* ; *Unsupported in 1.27.0*

The support for kernels older than 6.8 is deprecated as of 1.25.0. Starting from 1.27.0, Anbox Cloud will only be supported on kernels with version 6.8 and later.

## LXD 5.0
*Deprecated in 1.25.0* ; *Unsupported in 1.28.0*

The support for LXD 5.0 snap is deprecated as of 1.25.0. Upgrade your deployment to use LXD 5.21 instead

(sec-appliance-deprecation)=
## Anbox Cloud Appliance `epoch=0` snap
*Deprecated in 1.22.0* ; *Unsupported in 1.25.0*

The Anbox Cloud Appliance is being reworked. We will provide the new Anbox Cloud Appliance implementation using [Snap epochs](https://ubuntu.com/docs/snapcraft/9/how-to/crafting/manage-data-compatibility/).

The snap with `epoch=0` is the existing implementation that was deprecated in 1.22.0. Existing installations of the appliance will receive updates until Anbox Cloud 1.24.2.

Starting from 1.23.0, the snap with `epoch=1` will be the new implementation which is the default for new appliance installations. This implementation of the appliance will no longer use the Juju charmed operators internally but package all necessary service components directly within the snap. This helps to simplify the installation process and reduce overall footprint.

## Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)
*Deprecated in 1.22.0* ; *Unsupported in 1.24.0*

Support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) is deprecated in 1.22.0 and is planned to be removed in Anbox Cloud 1.24.0.

## EmuGL
*Deprecated in 1.22.0* ; *Unsupported in 1.23.0*

Support for the EmuGL renderer is deprecated in 1.22.0 and planned to be removed in Anbox Cloud 1.23.0. Starting with 1.22.0, VirGL will be the default renderer for NVIDIA GPUs with driver version 545 and later.

(etcd-and-easyrsa-charms)=
## etcd and EasyRSA charms
*Deprecated in 1.29.0* ; *Unsupported in 1.35.0*

Legacy charms, specifically the [`etcd`](https://charmhub.io/etcd) and the [`easy-rsa`](https://charmhub.io/easyrsa) charms, are deprecated as of Anbox Cloud 1.29.0 release. This aligns with the transition toward modernized, operator-based Anbox Cloud deployment.

Starting from 1.29.0, all new Anbox Cloud deployments must use modernized operator charms to replace their legacy counterparts. Specifically:

- [charmed-etcd](https://charmhub.io/charmed-etcd) to replace `etcd`
- [self-signed-certificates](https://charmhub.io/self-signed-certificates) to replace `easy-rsa`

This transition provides a two-year migration window before legacy charms become completely unsupported. Anbox Cloud 1.34.2 will be the last release that supports deployments using legacy charms. Starting from Anbox Cloud 1.35.0, Anbox Cloud deployments will exclusively support modernized charms.

## Applications, Addons and Registry in AMS
*Deprecated in 1.31.0* ; *Unsupported in 1.32.0*

Support for [applications](/howto/application/index.md), [addons](/howto/addons/index.md), and Anbox Application Registry [AAR](/howto/aar/index.md) is deprecated as of version 1.31.0.
- In 1.31.0: Creating applications and registry management via the Anbox Cloud dashboard is disabled. However, applications, addons, and registry management remains functional through the CLI for transition purposes.
- In 1.32.0: All support for applications, addons and registry will be officially removed. Users will no longer be able to create, manage, or utilize these features via the CLI or dashboard.
