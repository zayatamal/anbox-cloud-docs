Manage addons

## Synopsis

Manage addons.

Addons are a way of customising the images that are used as the base for containers.

Basically, an addon is a tarball that provides several hooks and additional metadata.
An example for an addon is one that enables the SSH service inside a container, to
provide access from the outside for any kind of automation of the container.

See https://canonical.com/anbox-cloud/docs/explanation/addons/ for more information.
