```{important}
These guides apply to images with containerized Android (`jammy:*`). The application model is not supported for images with virtualized Android. See {ref}`exp-android-execution-models` for details.
```

## Create and configure

Applications are packaged from Android APKs, extended with addons or hooks, and updated as needed.
