# Addons

```{important}
These guides apply to images with containerized Android (`jammy:*`). Addons are not supported for images with virtualized Android. See {ref}`exp-android-execution-environments` for details.
```

In Anbox Cloud, addons can be used to customize images that are used for instances. See {ref}`exp-addons` and {ref}`ref-addon-manifest` to learn about addons in detail.

You can use addons to, for example:

- Enable SSH access for automation tools (see {ref}`howto-create-addon`)
- Set up user-specific data when starting an application (see {ref}`howto-backup-restore-example`)
- Install additional tools in the instance (see {ref}`howto-install-tools-example`)
- Back up data when the instance is stopping (see {ref}`howto-backup-restore-example`)
- Configure the Android system before running the application (see {ref}`howto-customize-android-example`)
- Provide support for other platforms (see {ref}`howto-emulate-platforms-example`)

If you have used addons before Anbox Cloud 1.12, see {ref}`howto-migrate-addons` to update your addons to use the new hooks.
