# Access an instance

In some cases, it might be necessary to access an individual instance for debugging reasons.
You can do this on the command line with the `amc` command.

## Access an instance with `amc`

The `amc` command provides simple shell access to any instance managed by AMS. To access a specific instance you only need its ID:

    amc shell <id>

This command opens a bash shell inside the instance.

## Access the Android environment

The command for accessing Android depends on the instance's execution model.

### Containerized Android

Use anbox-shell to access the Android container. If you combine the anbox-shell command with amc exec, you can get direct access to the Android container:

    amc exec <id> -- anbox-shell

If you only want to watch the Android log output, use the following command:

    amc exec <id> -- anbox-shell logcat

`amc shell` and `amc exec` open various possibilities for automation use cases. See the help output of the commands for further details.

### Virtualized Android

Use `adb shell` instead of `anbox-shell` for an instance running virtualized Android. The command connects to the Android environment inside the Cuttlefish virtual machine:

    amc exec <id> -- adb shell
